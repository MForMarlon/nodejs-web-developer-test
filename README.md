# nodejs-web-developer-test

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to construct a working Node.js web application from scratch. The following web service generates 10 random programming jokes as a JSON list: https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/ten

At a minimum, you should render these jokes on a single page web app. However you want to process the JSON and then serve the html file is up to you. This is your chance to show us *everything* you know how to do. We *expect* you to do more than just the minimum.

Here is a helpful tip: Think about the end-user experience when the user visits the page. Do you show the punchline right away? Do you show all the jokes at once? How do you check for duplicate jokes? Can you think of additional features?

A simple, working server.js file is provided to help get you started. The only prerequisite is installing [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org).
