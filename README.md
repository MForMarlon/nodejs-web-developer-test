# nodejs-web-developer-test

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to construct a working Apple iTunes search page. We will leverage the free-to-use Apple iTunes api. The docs can be found [here](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/).

Think about the end-user experience when the user visits the page. What should they see when they first load the page? How do you display the results? What other features can you provide? This is your chance to show us *everything* you know how to do. We *expect* you to do more than just the minimum.

A simple, working server.js file is provided to help get you started. The only prerequisite is installing [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org) and you must use [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the front end.

Rules:
- You must fork this repository to your own Github account.
- You have one week to commit and push your final code. If you finish early and want me to review your code, tag me (@MForMarlon) in a pull request.
- You are welcome to use any frameworks you want. Check in your package.json file so we can see what you use.
- You are free to modify anything in this repository except this README.
- Some characteristics we are looking for in your code and commits include readability, documentation, and performance.
- If your implementation requires additional instructions, please provide them.

Best of luck!
